# Hospital-App
Hospital Mobile App
Overview
This project is a mobile application for a hospital that allows patients to view information about doctors, rate them, and book appointments.
The application also provides a system for assigning patients a number to reduce wait times and improve the patient experience.

Features
Doctor Profiles
Patients can view information about doctors, such as their name, specialty, education, and experience. 
Patients can also rate doctors based on their experience with them.

Appointment Booking
Patients can book appointments with doctors by selecting the desired doctor, date, and time slot.
Patients can also view their upcoming appointments and cancel them if necessary.

Patient Number System
The application assigns each patient a number upon arrival at the hospital. This number indicates the order in which the patient will be seen by the doctor,
reducing wait times and improving the patient experience.

Technologies Used
The application is built using React Native for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.
We used Firebase Authentication to authenticate users and Firebase Realtime Database to store data such as patient numbers and appointments.

Conclusion
This mobile application for a hospital provides a convenient and efficient way for patients to book appointments,
view information about doctors, and reduce wait times. The application can be further developed to include additional features such as payment integration 
and push notifications.

The source code for the application can be found in this repository, and can be used as a starting point for developing similar applications for hospitals
and healthcare providers.
